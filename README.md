# FastScan
I created this MATLAB-based GUI so that I could continually capture data from a fast-swept Keysight Tunable Laser.

The GUI has been tested with an Agilent DS05032A 2-channel real-time digital scope, and Keysight 8163B Mainframe with 81960A fast-swept tunable laser.  

Scope and laser mainframe were connected to computer via USB/VISA and GPIB, respectively.
