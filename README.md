# FastScan
I created this MATLAB-based GUI so that I could acquire the results of a continuous wavelength sweep of an Agilent/Keysight Tunable Laser in real time.

The GUI has been tested with an Agilent DS05032A 2-channel real-time digital scope, and Keysight 8163B Mainframe with 81962A fast-swept tunable laser.  

Scope and laser mainframe were connected to computer via USB/VISA and GPIB, respectively.
