# FastScan
MATLAB-based GUI that allows you to use a compatible Agilent/Keysight tunable laser and (oscillo)scope to capture the real-time results of a continuous wavelength sweep.

Tested with an Agilent DS05032A 2-channel real-time digital scope, and Keysight 8163B Mainframe with 81962A fast-swept tunable laser.  

Scope and laser mainframe were connected to computer via USB/VISA and GPIB (respectively).
